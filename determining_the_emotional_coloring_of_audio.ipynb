        "Данный модуль предназначен вывода распределения вероятностей эмоционального окраса по сегменту аудиодорожки, который выделятся из всего аудио, полученного благодаря tg-боту видео. Аудиодорожка делится на сегменты по спикерам на основании времени начала (1) и конца (2) фразы конкретного говорящего. (1) и (2) берутся из словоря модуля для транскрибирования и диаризации. Соответственно, благодаря связки этих двух модулей можно получить для каждого спикера последовательность распределений эмоций по всей встрече. Данную информацию можно в дальнейшем анализировать при помощи стандартных инструментов (pandas, matplotlib), либо при помощи других моделей машинного обучения."
